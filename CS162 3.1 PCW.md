## Questions:

### 1. Identity Access Management - IAM
It is crucial to get the access control correctly implemented.  As an example, consider logging onto ALF.  In this case there are students and professors, each of whom is part of multiple courses.  In each course one might have different roles - e.g. a professor might be a teacher in one class, while taking another class as a student.  Professors are able to do more things on the platform than
students, e.g. send the class to breakout.  There might be other actions as well, for example some students might be privileged with the option of enabling or disabling student drawing on slides.  When things break (as they sometimes do), then it will be really useful to have people with tech support privileges come into any class and perform any action.

Design a system which represents all parts of the problem and can flexibly assign students and professors to new classes. The system must also be able to efficiently determine whether a person is able to perform a particular action, such as sending the class to breakout.

(The model sketched out here is more flexible than the actual policy implemented in ALF.  As an alternative exercise, try to design how IAM is handled in ALF.)

### 2. Bug or feature?
Notice that a tomato can now also appear inside a fruit salad without any errors.  Is this a bug or a feature?  Make arguments for both sides.


### 3. Liskov Substitution principle
At the REPL, typing `type(x)` will show what type of variable `x` is, while `dir(x)` will reveal all the methods that x has.

Work through the simple types (e.g. list, int, float, string) and find out whether it is possible to call the following code with an instance of that type.  Is it possible to find an instance that works, while another instance (of the same type) fails?  

```python3
def liskov_substitution_principle(x):
    x = x % x
    x = x * 2
    print(x)
```
Is this a violation of the Liskov substitution principle? Why or why not?

### 4. (Optional) Multiple inheritance bug
There is a subtle bug in the initialization of a tomato.  Identify the bug, and then fix the bug!
