## Questions:

### 1. Identity Access Management - IAM
It is crucial to get the access control correctly implemented.  As an example, consider logging onto ALF.  In this case there are students and professors, each of whom is part of multiple courses.  In each course one might have different roles - e.g. a professor might be a teacher in one class, while taking another class as a student.  Professors are able to do more things on the platform than
students, e.g. send the class to breakout.  There might be other actions as well, for example some students might be privileged with the option of enabling or disabling student drawing on slides.  When things break (as they sometimes do), then it will be really useful to have people with tech support privileges come into any class and perform any action.

Design a system which represents all parts of the problem and can flexibly assign students and professors to new classes. The system must also be able to efficiently determine whether a person is able to perform a particular action, such as sending the class to breakout.

(The model sketched out here is more flexible than the actual policy implemented in ALF.  As an alternative exercise, try to design how IAM is handled in ALF.)

- On the ALF, the professor has mostly all the functionalities that students have. Initially, we can consider that ```class professor``` is enheriting all the attributes of ```class student``` (name, email). The aim of the IAM is to restrict certain functionalities to its appropriate users. I put the chat tagging as an example of overriding a method inhereted from ```class student```. We notice that only professors can call on all the class using ```@all``` but student can only tag each other.
- Alternatively, we can design functionalities (such as grading) to be in a form of ```class grading``` and only give access to professors and TAs.

### 2. Bug or feature?
Notice that a tomato can now also appear inside a fruit salad without any errors.  Is this a bug or a feature?  Make arguments for both sides.

- Tomato inhereted the methods of class Fruit and class Vegetable.  As an initial assessment, for an item to be part of the ```get_fruit_salad``` method, it has to have attributes (name, weight_kg) as well as the method ```ready_to_eat``` which as all part of being a fruit and Tomato class happen to have them, hence, it can appear in the fruit salad making it a feature.
- It can be a bug because although we didn't explicitly included Tomato in fruit salad,  the item has the ability to be part of that method, which is something that we didn't plan which puts it in a position of being a bug.


### 3. Liskov Substitution principle
At the REPL, typing `type(x)` will show what type of variable `x` is, while `dir(x)` will reveal all the methods that x has.

Work through the simple types (e.g. list, int, float, string) and find out whether it is possible to call the following code with an instance of that type.  Is it possible to find an instance that works, while another instance (of the same type) fails?  

```python3
def liskov_substitution_principle(x):
    x = x % x
    x = x * 2
    print(x)
```
Is this a violation of the Liskov substitution principle? Why or why not?
- The function only accepts float and int numbers with the exception of 0 as it return a ZeroDivisionError. This is an example of how a corner case can violate the LSP since 0 has the same type as float and int but is not compatible with the function ```liskov_substitution_principle(x)```.

### 4. (Optional) Multiple inheritance bug
There is a subtle bug in the initialization of a tomato.  Identify the bug, and then fix the bug!
