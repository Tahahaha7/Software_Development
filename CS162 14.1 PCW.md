## Continuous Integration
It is great if we have lots of testing code, but people tend not to be very
reliable at running the tests when they should (at least when compared to the
reliability of most computers).  Very often programmers  will commit code to
the repo without running the entire test suite.  This can significantly
complicate the debugging of an issue, since you can not be sure whether the bug
was introduced by your changes, or else by someone else's changes, but they
forgot to test it fully.

In time the value of a fully automated process has become clear. In this session
we will set up such an automated system which builds the entire environment from
scratch and runs all the necessary tests with every single push to a code repo.

1. Fork the following repo to your own personal account:
https://github.com/minerva-schools/cs162-continuous-integration
(You will notice the option to fork the repo on the top right hand side of the
github page.)

2. Sign into the Travis Continuous Integration site:
https://travis-ci.org/
And allow Travis to access the repo that you've just forked.  Now, whenever
you push any changes to any branch in that repo, Travis will be notified and
will download a copy of those changes, and run the whole build process.  If
the integration tests pass, then this will be shown on the github page.

3. Use the integration test that you wrote from the last session, and copy it
into the `tests` folder.  Include a `requirements.txt` file which contains all
the necessary dependencies. This can be easily generated with the following
command:
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

4. Update the `.travis.yml` file on the last line to point to your script.  
Notice that the script is no longer in the same folder as the `.travis.yml` file.
As an example, if your original integration tests ran with the command:
`python3 integrate.py`
Then you will need to update the yml file to have the line:
`python3 tests/integrate.py`


## Questions
Bring to class the URL of a successful integration run on Travis in your
personal account.  This will probably be a URL of the form:
`https://travis-ci.org/<user>/cs162-continuous-integration`
Or else you can identify a particular build:
`https://travis-ci.org/<user>/cs162-continuous-integration/builds/<build>`  
  
Link to the build:
`https://travis-ci.org/github/Tahahaha7/cs162-continuous-integration/builds/674424309`  

### 1. Read travis.yml
Read through the `.travis.yml` file in its entirety, and make sure you understand
each command, what it achieves, and why it has been included.  (There are one or
two commands which rely on a large amount of scripting, and it is ok if you
don't understand every aspect of those commands.)

Be prepared to explain these commands to the rest of the class.

### 2. SQL
Travis also provides access to a few common databases such as MySQL and
Postgres. In this case our project bundles a postgres database already.
What are the pros and cons of using the provided database, versus bundling
our own?
