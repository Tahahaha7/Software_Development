## A Cluster of containers

## Questions
Bring to class a copy of the output from `docker ps` when the entire stack has
been successfully deployed. This needs to be in plain text, so a screenshot is
not appropriate.  Be prepared to explain your answers for the questions below.
```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
17bae108bbdf        adminer:latest      "entrypoint.sh docke…"   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes        8080/tcp            cs162-swarm_adminer.1.73vgsvix2lwunp8aijd5xnmjh

### Q1. What has changed since last session?
Compare the differences between the session12_1 and session12_2 web directories.
What has changed, and why have those changes been made?  A useful command in
this case is the `diff` command.  (For those using windows, it is recommended
that you download the [DiffUtils for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm))
or other similar tool.

### Q2. What was different between manual and automatic configurations?
Compare the state of the system when we brought it up manually, and when we
brought it up using docker stack.  There is one large obvious difference.  
What is it, and what impact might this have on the system?  

### Q3. Inspect the database
1. Submit several calculations to the server.
2. Visiting http://localhost:8080 will take you to a database admin login page.
Either by examining the manual commands, or by examining the
`docker-compose.yml` file find the information needed to log into the database.
3. Confirm that the necessary calculations are visible in the database.

### Q4. Bigger picture
Sketch out the bigger picture.  What parts are running on your computer, and
how do they interact with each other?  If there is terminology or acronyms that
you don't understand, search for an explanation on the internet, and bring these
explanation(s) to class to help your fellow students.
