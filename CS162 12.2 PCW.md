## Questions
Bring to class a copy of the output from `docker ps` when your container is successfully running. This needs to be in plain text, so a screenshot is not appropriate.  Be prepared to explain your answers for the questions below.

```bash
Taha@DESKTOP-CH358ND MINGW64 ~/desktop/Spring 2020/cs162/session12_1/web (master)
$ docker ps  
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
cd1091c153e2        simple-cs162-flask   "python app.py"     About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   simple-cs162-instance
```

### Q1. Bigger picture
Sketch out the bigger picture.  What parts are running on your computer, and how do they interact with each other?  If there is terminology or acronyms that you don't understand, search for an explanation on the internet, and bring these explanation(s) to class to help your fellow students.

Sketch this out as a picture, in a format suitable for pasting into a group document, and bring it to class.

### Q2. Data persistence
Does the computation server persist data if it is stopped?  How can you tell?

### Q3. Environment variables
Read up on environment variables, and how Python accesses these variables.
