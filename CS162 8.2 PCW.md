## Data Normalization
Data normalization refers to the degree to which potentially-shared
information is moved into separate tables.

## Questions
### Definitions of normalization
Search the internet and find good definitions and examples of the following:
- First normal form:
  - Each cell has to be single valued
  - Same entry types for the columns
  - Rows uniquely identified (Adding IDs)

- Second normal form 
  - All attributes depend on the ID key
  - If not then the dataset has to be seperated

- Third normal form:
  - All attributes can be determined only by the key in the table

- Forth normal form:
  - No multi-valued dependencies within the table.

- Denormalization:\
It's the process of joining data from two or more normalized tables (also called flattening the data).  

- Composite key:\
They're used when uniqueness is guaranteed if columns are combined.

### Road racing association
##### Description
You are contracted out to set up a database for an association of road-runners.
They organize many different races through-out the year. Some of the races get
put into different challenges.  So for example, there could be the following
races:
- The ruby marathon
- The bridge challenge
- The sea to mountain sprint
- Flat and fast marathon
- The wine route stroll

And there could be two challenges:
- **The marathon challenge:**
    - the ruby marathon;
    - the flat and fast marathon.
- **The terrain challenge:**
    - the bridge challenge;
    - the sea to mountain;
    - the ruby marathon.

Notice that not all races belong to a challenge, and some races belong to more
than one challenge.  These challenges repeat every year, but
with subtle differences sometimes (e.g. a new race might be included,
or a particular race is unable to be run that year).

The association needs to be able to keep track of which runners entered
which races, and what their running times were.  A few weeks after the
final race in a particular challenge has been run, the results will get
emailed or posted out.

##### Design
1. Design all the SQL tables you need to capture the above requirements.
2. Write the `CREATE TABLE` statements to implement your design.
3. `INSERT` some example data that you have made up.
4. Write a SQL query to find the top 3 fastest women runners for a given race.
5. Write a SQL query to find all the runners' email addresses that
successfully finished the marathon challenge.

**Bring your design to class and be prepared to explain it**
