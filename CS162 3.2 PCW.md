### 1. A base object
Python provides certain functionality to all classes.


At the REPL, typing `type(x)` will show what type of variable `x` is, while `dir(x)` will reveal all the methods that x has.  Investigate the default behavior t.  Examine the behavior that python gives a using the following few lines of code:

```python
class BlankClass(object):
    '''This is a Blank class for CS162.'''
    pass
t = BlankClass()

class ClassWithAttr(object):
    x1 = 1
    x2 = 2

my_attr = ClassWithAttr()
my_attr.x3 = 3
```

Now find out about the following methods:
 1. help(t)
 ```
 Help on BlackClass in module __main__ object:

class BlackClass(builtins.object)
 |  Data descriptors defined here:
 |
 |  __dict__
 |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
 |
 |  __weakref__
 |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)        

None
 ```
 2. type(t)
 ```
 <class '__main__.BlackClass'>
 ```
 3. dir(t)
 ```
 ['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__',
 '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__',
 '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__',
 '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 
'__weakref__']
 ```
 4. hash(t)
 ```
 -2143977886
 ```
 5. id(t)
 ```
 15263272
 ```
 6. hasattr(my_attr,'x3')
 ```python
 True
 ```
 7. getattr(my_attr,'x3')
 ```
 3
 ```
 8. delattr(my_attr,'x3')
 ```python
 None
 ```
 9. vars(my_attr)
 ```python
 {'x3': 3}
 ```
10. bool(t)
```python
 True
 ```
 
 
 ### 3. Graphics in Python
Most graphics in python is done using the bundled Tkinter package (https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/tkinter.html).  

Look at the source code for Tkinter here:
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.5/Lib/tkinter/__init__.py
This is a really long file, so clearly you are not expected to
read every line.  But being able to identify the major classes from a large
file is very useful when starting to work on an existing project.

1. Build up a list of all the classes defined in the tkinter library, and all
the parent classes that it inherits from.
2. Now choose a class that inherits from widget and list all the methods that
one can call on that widget.
3. Find a simple online tutorial on tkinter and build a simple graphical user
interface.  How much of the complexity of the library can be hidden from an
enduser?

*Come to class with your example code and be able to explain both the design
behind the Tkinter library and how polymorphism helps build a flexible graphics
library.*
